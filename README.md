# Innovations in Dropout Techniques with Sector-wise and LRP-guided Approaches
This repository is the official implementation of "Enhancing Generalization in Neural Networks: Innovations in Dropout Techniques with Sector-wise and LRP-guided Approaches" paper.
The Sector-wise dropout approach systematically divides the nodes in each layer into sectors, applying deactivation based on a fixed dropout probability to ensure a more structured network architecture. LRP-guided Dropout leverages scores from Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (LRP), computed subsequent to parameter updates, to selectively deactivate nodes positioned within the highest percentile of LRP scores. Through empirical evaluation, we establish that these innovative approaches markedly enhance the balance and generalization capacity of neural networks, thus representing a significant progression in mitigating the overfitting conundrum.

A conceptual diagram of the classical dropout method and the proposed methods. (a) Standard network. (b) Sub-network
generated by the classical dropout. (c) Nodes within each layer form sectors, and a subset of these nodes is randomly dropped at a given dropout rate p. (d) LRP relevance scores are computed for all nodes in each layer. Subsequently, a proportion of top p Ã— 100% of the nodes in the layer are selectively dropped out, based on their LRP relevance scores.

## Methods
### Sector-wise dropout
Proposed sector-wise dropout technique, applied to a hidden layer, involves dividing the nodes in the hidden layer into several sectors. Each sector contains n nodes, where n is generally chosen so that it is a divisor of the total number of nodes, although this is not a strict requirement. With the sector-wise dropout, we randomly deactivate m nodes in each sector, ensuring that the ratio m n matches the intended dropout probability p. This method differs significantly from the classical dropout approaches. The sector-wise dropout precisely aligns the proportion of deactivated nodes in each sector with the predetermined dropout rate p, offering a more controlled approach to node deactivation.

### LRP-guided dropout
Our research introduces a novel approach called LRP-guided dropout to enhance network training. This method leverages relevance scores from LRP to refine training. By the LRP algorithm, starting from the output and moving towards the input layer, each node is assigned a relevance score. A key feature of this method is its focus on the absolute values of these relevance scores. During back-propagation, nodes with the highest absolute relevance scores in each layer are identified and selectively disabled based on the dropout rate. This approach recognizes the equal importance of both highly positive and negative values in the affect of network behavior and performance.
